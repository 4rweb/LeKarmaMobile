            <h4>PBS Teachers</h4>
            <p>PBS has a long-standing reputation in the education community as a provider of high-quality teaching resources and services. As a global portal for all the materials developed across their station sites, PBS Teachers allows educators - from Pre-K all the way through 12th grade - to navigate a diverse, rich, and ever-changing body of resources.  Accordingly, PBS Teachers faces the challenge of organizing the information in a coherent way. Viget was hired to conduct user research and to redesign the site. A priority with the redesign was to establish a consistent browsing experience that would be able to scale as new resources are added. We also needed to create a way for users to browse and rate content that lives on external sites without actually exiting the PBS Teachers site. We were honored to work with such a talented team at PBS on this satisfying project.</p>
            <h5>What We Did:</h5>
            <p><strong>Sitemap</strong> to establish a coherent hierarchy for the site's extensive content.<br />
<strong>Wireframes</strong> to illustrate page layout across the site.<br />
<strong>User Research</strong> to guide our process and ensure teachers will be able to take full advantage of the rich content.<br />
<strong>Original design</strong> to align with the new PBS brand strategy and help PBS Teachers reach its full potential.</p>
